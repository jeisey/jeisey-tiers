# UX / Visual Product Specification

## 1. Design direction

The site is a **draft utility**, not a sports-media homepage.

Visual character:

- clean
- compact
- high information density
- restrained typography
- neutral surfaces
- strong hierarchy
- minimal ornament
- charts first, tables equally important

Avoid:

- hero art
- gradients for decoration
- glassmorphism
- animated backgrounds
- oversized metric cards
- marketing claims above the data
- fantasy-football clichés (helmets, flames, trophies) unless they serve navigation

## 2. Page anatomy

Desktop order:

```text
[Product name]    Updated <timestamp>    [Methodology]

[Scoring: PPR] [Teams: 12] [Position: ALL]     [Search player]

[Tiers] [Arbitrage] [Data]
---------------------------------------------------------
Primary visualization
---------------------------------------------------------
Compact context / legend / controls
---------------------------------------------------------
Sortable table + export
---------------------------------------------------------
Source/model footer
```

Do not bury the chart under a large header.

## 3. Global state

Persist to URL query parameters:

- tab
- scoring
- teams
- position
- search (optional)

Example semantic state, not binding URL syntax:

`?view=tiers&scoring=ppr&teams=12&position=rb`

State must survive reload/back-forward.

## 4. Header

Contains:

- short product name/logo wordmark only
- last successful refresh, e.g. `Updated Aug 12 · 7:23 AM ET`
- degraded/stale marker if metadata says so
- Methodology/Data link

Avoid navigation beyond what the app needs.

## 5. Tier Board

### 5.1 Core visual metaphor

Horizontal stacked lanes resembling a highly refined S-tier list.

Each lane:

- fixed left rail with tier label (`S`, `A`, ...)
- player marks placed horizontally according to intrinsic DraftValue/VORP, not equal spaced
- subtle horizontal scale/grid if helpful
- vertical order within a lane may use collision avoidance or compact rows; do not imply extra meaning unless encoded

Potential sketch:

```text
S | Bijan ━━━━━●━━━━   Chase ━━━●━━
A | Gibbs ━━━●━━  Lamb ━━━●━━  Jefferson ━━●━━
B | ...
```

The uncertainty interval should appear as a muted line/whisker behind or around a focal point.

### 5.2 Player mark

At default zoom:

- abbreviated position rank (e.g. RB3)
- player last name or full name depending width
- team abbreviation

On hover/focus/click details:

- fair overall rank
- expected/median VORP
- P25/P75 and P10/P90
- expected fantasy points
- uncertainty label
- tier-boundary context if adjacent to a cliff

Player headshots are not required and should not create an image-rights dependency.

### 5.3 All-position vs position view

All-position board uses league-adjusted VORP and exposes position badges.

Position-only view may use the same league-adjusted VORP or position-relative display scale; the UI must not silently change the metric. Label the axis.

### 5.4 Tier cliff cues

At the right/left boundary between segments, optional subtle annotation:

- `value cliff`
- boundary stability/strength in tooltip

Do not clutter every boundary with a text label.

## 6. Draft Rail arbitrage chart

### 6.1 Core visual metaphor

A paired-anchor/slope rail for each player:

```text
Fair/model pick                          Market ADP
34 ●──────────────────────────────● 67   Player Name
```

Coordinate system should make **positive bargain direction intuitively obvious**. Because earlier picks are numerically smaller, consider reversing the x-axis or adding explicit labels so users do not need to reason about number direction.

Recommended visual semantics:

- model/fair anchor = distinct geometric shape
- market anchor = another shape
- connector length = value gap
- arrow/direction or text label communicates bargain/overpay
- sorting defaults to arbitrage score, not raw fair rank

### 6.2 Default population

Show top value opportunities, not all 300 players simultaneously. Default perhaps top 25–40 by positive arbitrage score, with controls to show overvalued/all.

Full table contains everything.

### 6.3 Details

Hover/focus/click:

- fair rank
- ADP
- ADP spread/sample size
- raw gap
- expected surplus VORP if ML mode
- P(positive surplus) if calibrated
- market trend since prior day/week
- intrinsic P10/P50/P90
- arbitrage mode (`Model` or `Market-gap baseline`)

## 7. Tables

### 7.1 Tier table columns

Default visible:

- Fair Rank
- Player
- Pos
- Team
- Tier
- Expected VORP
- P25–P75 VORP or Floor/Ceiling compact columns
- Expected FP
- Uncertainty

Optional column picker may expose P10/P90 and model metadata if easy, but do not overbuild.

### 7.2 Arbitrage table columns

Default:

- Arbitrage Rank
- Player
- Pos
- Team
- Fair Rank
- Market ADP
- Value Gap
- Arbitrage Score
- Expected Surplus (ML only)
- P+ Surplus (ML only)
- Market Trend
- Confidence

Columns that are unavailable in baseline mode should be omitted or rendered `—` with an explanation, not fabricated.

### 7.3 Table behavior

- compact rows (~36–44 px target)
- sticky header
- obvious sort indicators
- zebra striping optional and subtle
- keyboard focus visible
- no horizontal-scroll surprise on desktop; mobile may scroll or switch to essential columns

## 8. Export

Place export action near table controls, not hidden in a menu hierarchy.

Options:

- `Download full CSV`
- `Export filtered CSV`

Filename pattern:

`ffdraft-tiers-ppr-12-2026-08-12.csv`

and analogous arbitrage file.

## 9. Methodology/Data tab

This is not a long blog post.

Show concise sections:

### What the two models do

- Tier = intrinsic football value, no ADP/ECR input
- Arbitrage = intrinsic value versus draft market

### Freshness

Table of source → as-of → status.

### Model

- version
- trained through season
- top-level holdout metrics
- arbitrage mode baseline/ML

### Definitions

- VORP
- Fair Rank
- ADP
- Arbitrage Score
- prediction intervals

### Sources/attribution

Required source/license attribution links.

Detailed model cards can link to repository files.

## 10. Empty/degraded/error states

### Player absent from market

Tier output remains valid. Arbitrage row may be omitted or marked `No market ADP`.

### Market stale

Arbitrage tab banner: concise, e.g. `Market data is 2 days old; rankings shown from last verified snapshot.`

### Optional source down

No dramatic error if critical output remains valid. Methodology/source status notes degraded source.

### Unsupported URL config

Normalize to nearest valid/default config and update URL; do not crash.

### Artifact schema mismatch

Render a clear technical error with expected vs received schema version; fail safe.

## 11. Responsive design

### Desktop >= 1024

Full chart + table.

### Tablet ~768–1023

Primary target too. Controls may wrap into two compact rows. Chart remains full-featured.

### Mobile < 768

- sticky compact controls or horizontally scrollable segmented control where accessible
- Tier Board may use vertical card alignment inside lanes with axis simplified
- Draft Rail can stack player rows
- table uses essential columns and horizontal scroll or a compact row detail expander

Do not create a completely separate mobile product.

## 12. Accessibility

- semantic buttons, inputs, tables
- SVG chart marks focusable or mirrored in an accessible list/table
- chart has text summary and nearby data table; table is the definitive accessible equivalent
- `aria-live` only for important state updates, not every filter interaction
- tooltips accessible by keyboard/focus
- reduced motion disables animated transitions
- tier label text always visible
- positive/negative arbitrage also uses arrow/direction/sign text

## 13. Animation

Allowed only for continuity when changing filters, e.g. 100–200 ms position transitions.

No entrance choreography. Respect reduced motion.

## 14. Visual QA acceptance

Capture Playwright screenshots for at least:

- Tier Board desktop PPR 12-team ALL
- Tier Board tablet RB
- Arbitrage Board desktop
- methodology/data view
- mobile Tier Board
- stale/degraded market state

Use screenshot review to catch clipping, label overlap, unreadable scales, and Pages base-path failures. Pixel-perfect snapshots should not become brittle blockers for dynamic data unless fixtures are fixed.
