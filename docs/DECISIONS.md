# Architecture Decision Records

This file records binding architecture/product decisions. Coding agents should append ADRs for material deviations rather than silently changing the system.

## ADR-001 — Static runtime architecture

**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** V1 uses precomputed static JSON/CSV rendered by React/Vite and hosted on GitHub Pages. No runtime backend/database.

**Why:** zero recurring infra cost, simple deployment, reproducible builds, sufficient for daily rather than real-time cadence.

**Revisit if:** live draft synchronization, arbitrary custom scoring requiring server computation, user accounts, or source licensing makes browser artifact delivery impractical.

---

## ADR-002 — Intrinsic value is market-independent

**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** ADP, ECR, expert ranks, FantasyCalc market values, and other crowd price signals are forbidden intrinsic-model inputs.

**Why:** preserves independent value estimate and makes arbitrage meaningful rather than circular.

**Revisit if:** never for the intrinsic model. A separate hybrid/consensus product could be added under a different name later.

---

## ADR-003 — Arbitrage may launch in baseline mode

**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** If Phase-0 historical free ADP coverage is insufficient for leakage-safe ML training/holdouts, ship deterministic market-gap arbitrage and accumulate daily history. Do not fabricate or overclaim an ML model.

**Why:** a transparent baseline is more useful and scientifically honest than a learned model trained on weak/non-point-in-time data.

---

## ADR-004 — Time-aware evaluation only

**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** player-season models use rolling chronological folds. Random train/test split across seasons is prohibited.

**Why:** production is future-season forecasting and many features/source schemas drift over time.

---

## ADR-005 — Canonical ID joins; no name-only production joins

**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** GSIS/crosswalk IDs drive joins. Name matching can only propose resolver candidates and must fail closed when ambiguous.

**Why:** player names/suffixes/team changes cause silent corruption.

---

## ADR-006 — Public market history must be retained

**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** daily market snapshots are persisted in a durable versioned mechanism separate from transient Actions artifacts.

**Why:** point-in-time ADP is core future training data and may not be reconstructable.

---

## ADR-007 — Baseline-first model promotion

**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** retain explicit naive/simple baselines and promote complexity only after rolling holdout improvement.

**Why:** prevents sophisticated but unvalidated modeling and keeps claims measurable.

---

## ADR-008 — Tables are canonical UX truth surface

**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** build typed data tables before/alongside bespoke charts; charts must agree with table/artifact values.

**Why:** supports draft-day utility, accessibility, export, and visual QA.

---

## ADR-009 — Phase-0 source verification runs on a GitHub-hosted runner

**Status:** Accepted (2026-08-17)

**Decision:** the reproducible source probe (`scripts/source_probe.py`) is executed on a GitHub-hosted runner via `.github/workflows/source-probe.yml`, and the runner commits its report to the working branch. A probe status of `blocked_egress` means the *execution environment* refused the connection and is never evidence about the source.

**Why:** the development sandbox used for Phase 0 sits behind an egress policy that answers `403` to `CONNECT` for `api.myfantasyleague.com`, `api.sleeper.app`, `fantasycalc.com`, `docs.sleeper.com` and others, while permitting PyPI and the nflverse release hosts. Verification is impossible there by construction. A GitHub runner has open egress *and* is the environment the production workflows will run in, so evidence gathered there describes the environment that actually matters.

**Consequences:** any future source verification must be run through this workflow (or another unrestricted environment) rather than trusted from a local run; a local run is still useful as a fast syntax/logic check.

**Revisit if:** the project acquires a development environment with unrestricted egress, or GitHub Actions stops being the production execution environment.

## ADR-010 — Arbitrage V1 ships in deterministic baseline mode

**Status:** Accepted (2026-08-17). Confirms ADR-003 with evidence.

**Decision:** `arbitrage_ml_historical_feasible = false`. V1 computes the transparent fair-rank-vs-ADP baseline and labels it a baseline. No learned surplus model, no `expected_surplus_vorp`, no `p_positive_surplus` in public artifacts.

**Why:** MFL's ADP export carries seven usable historical seasons (362–445 priced players each), so volume is not the problem. The problem is timing: the export returns a season-long aggregate recomputed at request time, and the day-window filter is ignored — `DAYS=30` against 2019 returned exactly the unfiltered result (445 rows, `totalDrafts=15850`). A historical "market cost" therefore includes drafts held after the season's outcomes were partly known, which would contaminate the very feature a learned arbitrage model exists to exploit. Draft-type filters (`IS_MOCK`, `IS_KEEPER`) do work historically but say nothing about when a price was set.

**Revisit when:** at least three draft seasons of our own append-only point-in-time snapshots exist (ADR-006), at which point an honest out-of-time promotion gate becomes possible. Until then, snapshot retention is the highest-value arbitrage work in the repository.

## ADR-011 — Current player status comes from nflverse rosters plus Sleeper, not nflverse injuries

**Status:** Accepted (2026-08-17)

**Decision:** current-state status for inference is assembled from `load_rosters(target_season).status` / `depth_chart_position`, the timestamped depth-chart snapshots (2025+), and the Sleeper player map's `status` / `injury_status` / `injury_body_part` / `practice_participation` fields. `load_injuries` is used for historical feature work only, never as a current-state feed.

**Why:** `load_injuries` returns weekly in-season injury reports (weeks 1–22) and the installed loader rejects seasons after 2025. There is consequently **no** nflverse injury report available at a preseason draft anchor in any season, which is a different and larger gap than the "feed died after 2024" assumption in the original spec. Sleeper publishes preseason status/injury fields and is verified reachable; nflverse rosters carry `status` for every current player.

**Consequences:** Sleeper becomes an `important` (not merely optional) current-state dependency, and its non-commercial terms therefore bind the deployment (see ADR-013's non-commercial note and `docs/SECURITY_LICENSE.md` section 10). Joins go nflverse → Sleeper on `sleeper_id`, because Sleeper's own `gsis_id` coverage is only 31.9%.

## ADR-012 — Market cohorts are approximate and must be labelled as such

**Status:** Accepted (2026-08-17)

**Decision:** market snapshots are sourced from the widest reliable MFL cohort rather than one request per scoring × league-size preset. Each serialized market/arbitrage row records the filters actually used in `source_format_detail` and carries an explicit `cohort_approximate` entry in `quality_flags` whenever the row's preset is not an exact match for the requested cohort. The UI must not imply preset-specific ADP that the source cannot support.

**Why:** MFL cohort filters work individually (`IS_PPR=1` → 370 rows, `FCOUNT=12` → 356, `FCOUNT=14` → 242) but their intersections collapse: `IS_PPR=0&FCOUNT=10` returned **2** priced players on 2026-08-17. Nine exact preset cohorts cannot be populated from this source, and silently serving a two-player cohort would be worse than serving a labelled approximation. Fabricating nine distinct cohorts from one aggregate without labelling would be a truthfulness failure.

**Consequences:** Phase 5 owns the implementation; `schemas/market_snapshot.schema.json` needs no structural change because `quality_flags` and `source_format_detail` already exist. Arbitrage confidence/data-sufficiency flags must reflect cohort approximation, and cohort mix should be re-measured closer to peak draft season, when thin cohorts may fill in.

## ADR-013 — FantasyCalc is disabled for V1

**Status:** Accepted (2026-08-17)

**Decision:** no FantasyCalc access of any kind in V1 — not as a production source, not as a secondary signal. The probe reads only the published terms page, never data.

**Why:** `docs/DATA_SOURCES.md` section 7 permits use only if a *documented, permitted* retrieval mechanism is confirmed. No published CSV/download or documented public API was found, and the terms page serves 113,878 bytes of client-rendered HTML with no terms text in the markup, so the policy cannot be verified programmatically. Reachability of an undocumented endpoint is explicitly not sanction. A permissive `robots.txt` is not a licence.

**Revisit if:** FantasyCalc publishes a documented reuse mechanism, or a human records a reading of the current terms plus written permission where required. The arbitrage path does not depend on this source.

---

## ADR-014 — FantasyPros-derived ECR benchmark is disabled pending a human terms review

**Status:** Accepted (2026-08-17)

**Decision:** `load_ff_rankings` is not used, even for internal benchmarking, until a human reads the current FantasyPros terms and records a decision. Consensus comparison for V1 uses the verified public MFL ADP and the declared naive baselines. No ECR-derived value, and no metric computed from ECR, appears in any public artifact.

**Why:** `docs/DATA_SOURCES.md` section 8 says to disable the benchmark when terms are unclear. They are: the dynastyprocess mirror that distributes the data publishes no licence or terms statement, and the FantasyPros terms page serves 215,237 bytes of client-rendered HTML with no terms text in the markup. Convenient access through nflverse tooling does not transfer rights.

**Consequences:** the PRD's "beats consensus" comparison (section 12.4) is scoped to market ADP for V1, which is legitimate because ADP is itself a crowd-expectation baseline. Any future claim about beating expert consensus requires this ADR to be revisited first. Note the probe already suppresses rows from this source so nothing benchmark-only can leak into the report or fixtures.

## ADR-015 — Depth charts have two schemas; historical anchor depth is not directly available

**Status:** Accepted (2026-08-17)

**Decision:** the depth-chart adapter normalises two upstream formats behind one internal contract: the pre-2025 weekly format (`season/club_code/week/depth_team/depth_position`) and the 2025-onward timestamped snapshot format (`dt/team/pos_abb/pos_rank/pos_slot`). Point-in-time anchor depth is taken as the latest snapshot with `dt <= anchor` for 2025+. For 2024 and earlier, anchor depth may **not** be taken from the week-1 depth chart without an explicit, documented leakage caveat; the default is to derive anchor depth context from prior-season usage and roster status instead.

**Why:** the upstream source changed at 2025. Row counts show it plainly: 2024 → 37,312 weekly rows, 2025 → 554,215 snapshot rows across 221 timestamps, 2026 → 442,872 across 150 timestamps beginning 2026-03-22. Pre-2025 data starts at week 1 with no preseason observation, and week 1 is published after final roster cuts and after a typical late-August draft, so treating it as draft-time information leaks.

**Consequences:** Phase 2 must record the anchor-depth derivation per season era in the feature dictionary, and a leakage test must assert that no pre-2025 training row consumes a depth observation dated after its anchor. Current-season inference is unaffected and in fact better served, because daily snapshots give an exact anchor.
